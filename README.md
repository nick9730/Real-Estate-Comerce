React-Real-Estate-eCommerce
I built one appliaction with Vite+React and for styling I used styled-components.

This site contains: 

1. Animation from framer-motion,
2. Routers from React-Router-Dom,
3. Fetching data from supabase,
4. useHooks for filters,
5. Usage of React-Query,
6. i18next for language,
7. Pagination,
8. Google Maps Api



The user could search the properties with any value such as (price,location,beds,baths & etc....). Also, the user could share the link of filters because i have used setSearchParams.In additional,the user could find the location of property in the google-maps.
